# This Repository is Not Mimicked

First of all, this is a raw repository where I've delivered whatever I've learned, according to my codes and notes (in the form of comments). I believe this might help me in the future when I want to revisit and go through some concepts!

## What This Repo Includes

This repository contains all the codes for HTML, CSS, and JS from my learning sessions.

### Projects

I've tried to include project codes made in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but I will also add all projects externally outside of this repo.

**P.S.** I've excluded all those days which were just theory; I've posted only practical stuff.

**If this repo helps you in any way, just give it a star; it won't harm you ;)**

## What's Included and Gonna Include in This Repo:

- [x] **Codes** in HTML, CSS, JS, and Tailwind CSS (for now)
- [x] **Mini-Projects/Projects** based on the above points
- [x] **Some codes have notes** in the form of comments which might be helpful
- [ ] **Future additions** like React, Node.js, and more
